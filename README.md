## Hi there, I'm Dave Roberts, AKA Dave the IT Guy ðŸ‘‹

I have a [blog](http://davetheitguy.blog)!

### Who am I?

Hi, I'm Dave Roberts, a developer from the south-west of England.

I have been developing for around 20 years, and am well-versed in Kotlin, Java, CSS, and C#. For now (and the foreseeable future) I work professionally mainly doing Perl, JavaScript, TypeScript, and SCSS.

### What am I good at?

I am quite an accomplished JavaScript/Frontend engineer - I am very good at working within frameworks and with good old vanilla JavaScript, but I also have a talent for Java, Kotlin, and Perl (mainly)

### What am I working on?

I am working on several projects right now, the main one is The Globally Accessible Data Store (GADS) which I'm working on for [CtrlO](HTTP://www.ctrlo.com). I'm also creating several JavaScript libraries for use within projects, which will gradually start to show up here.

Previously, I worked for [BioRisk Ltd](HTTP://www.bioriskltd.co.uk). in creating their (property) inventory software system; this includes an Android application for data collection, an admin portal for editing reports, and a customer portal for retrieving said reports.

### What else can I do?

I'm also quite good with containers, and container orchestration, as well as CI/CD, and cloud services.
